# AngelsEye Camera for Android

The camera here was built using the [Camera2API sample](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-Camera2Basic) for the base camera part. 
It has been modified to take continuous photos at a lower resolution, prepare the photo with details such as time and geocordinates, then 
send the photo to a server for firearm detection. This is done with little to no delay to ensure maximum effectiveness in regards to the purpose of this project (security).
